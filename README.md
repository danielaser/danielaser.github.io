# Welcome to my personal portfolio

You are going to find some information about myself and my work as a Front End developer.
This is the link to my website https://danielaser.github.io 

I worked with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS and I implemented a librery called Fullpage.js. There is the documentation (https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/tree/master/lang/spanish#fullpagejs) 

I published my page with github pages. There is the documentation (https://pages.github.com/)

Enjoy! :)
